- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabian A. Becerra
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Architecture, Software Design and Software development, IoT and any type of technological advance in general! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all Data Science topics (struggling with math mainly, since my bases are not the best) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

The material prior to 2020 has been removed from the repository for multiple reasons, some were so old that they were already obsolete, others very outdated and github showed errors due to security issues, and others were a bit sad, so in the end I decided it was better start from scratch. &#128522;

Warning - Also keep in mind that the repositories are mainly focused on study material, so sometimes it can be very basic, but it is for academic purposes, and lately I have had to teach many basic courses!
