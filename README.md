- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabian A. Becerra
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Architecture, Software Design and Software development, IoT and any type of technological advance in general! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all Data Science topics (struggling with math mainly, since my bases are not the best) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

The material prior to 2020 has been removed from the repository for multiple reasons, some were so old that they were already obsolete, others very outdated and github showed errors due to security issues, and others were a bit sad, so in the end I decided it was better start from scratch. &#128522;

**Warning** - Keep in mind that much of the material in the repositories is of an educational nature, I have created it as part of the material that I use to teach the various programming courses that I currently teach, so you may find it very basic or incomplete, and It's because of the academic focus, and lately I've had to teach a lot of basic courses!
